# The Smart Way to do it

The website proposal for Smart Consulting.

**The idea:**
Some days ago i was trying to create simple static website, but honest setup everything as webpack, hot reload, watch... took a lotttt of time, so navigating trought the internet i found a video on youtube about a Guy setup everything a was needing in just a few minutes.

Then i try and its true, [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is amazing, powerfull and simple.

So i decided to study a little and create an page.

So i'll apreciate a lot any kind of commits to improve this page also to learn a little more about Vite.
